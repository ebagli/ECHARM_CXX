# DYNECHARM++

A toolkit for the simulation of coherent interactions between high-energy charged particles and complex crystal structures.
The code has been written in C++ language taking advantage of this object-oriented programing method.
The code is capable to evaluating the electrical characteristics of complex atomic structures and to simulate and track the particle trajectory within them.
Calculation method of electrical characteristics based on their expansion in Fourier series has been adopted.
Two different approaches to simulate the interaction have been adopted, relying on the full integration of particle trajectories under the continuum potential approximation and on the definition of cross-sections of coherent processes.
Finally, the code has proved to reproduce experimental results and to simulate interaction of charged particles with complex structures.
